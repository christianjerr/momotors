                <p class="mt-5">The new YZONE was opened on January 30, 2016 after a move from its former location in Ortigas. This was no mere change of location; this was a reinvention of Yamaha’s Flagship shop which has transformed into the country’s newest and most exciting motorcycle hub. </p>
                <p>A beautiful façade welcomes the customers upon their arrival and with wide glass windows giving them a glimpse of what’s inside. Once you go through the doors, you will immediately have access to the world’s finest innovations. This spacious facility houses Yamaha’s best products, machines that apply to every lifestyle. Experience service that is at par with global standards as the Yzone staff is ready to take you on a journey of Yamaha’s greatest creations. </p>
                <b class="float-right">THE DESIGN</b><br>
                
                <p>Yamaha always had its own design philosophy, an art form that encompasses all its products around the world which also includes its facilities. Refined Dynamism is the artistic reasoning behind the brand’s blueprint. It’s the harmony between mechanical structure and the human perspective. The store is embedded with multiple elements that complement each other, making the in-store experience better than ever. This harmony goes beyond the structure; it gives customers an immediate connection that allows them to truly feel “Revs your Heart”.</p>
